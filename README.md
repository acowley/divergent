# Diverging Color Maps for Scientific Visualization

This is a friendly fork of Kenneth Moreland's [original work](https://www.kennethmoreland.com/color-maps/) on producing color maps that help visualize changing values with colors without introducing spurious apparent discontinuities.

This fork updates the code hosted on the original author's website to work with VTK-8.
